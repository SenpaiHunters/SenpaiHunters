# About me:

👋 Hi, I’m @SenpaiHunters, some call me [Kami](https://www.youtube.com/@Kami_YT)!

I am the creator of [SpotOn](https://github.com/SenpaiHunters/SpotOn), a browser extension for Spotify. There is a lot, this includes various visual enhancements such as animation effects, rounded album covers and hover animations, as well as functional improvements such as a dynamic theme that responds to the album art and an auto-lyric search feature on Genius, rainbow controls, and more to discover.
