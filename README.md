# Hi! I'm Kami! Welcome to my profile!

I am the creator of [SpotOn](https://github.com/SenpaiHunters/SpotOn), a browser extension for Spotify. I made the block script for Arc Advanced (and maintain that). I have created many CLIs to use and published a few extensions, notably SpotOn. There isn't much to chat about; most things I do are open source! So enjoy it... If you ever have a question, shoot me a DM on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/325178652033679362). If you wish to support me, [BuyMeACoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/KamiAMVS), and that's it!
